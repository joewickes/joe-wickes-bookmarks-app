User stories completed: 

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
- title
- url link
- description
- rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view

Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark

Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)
I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection

(Extension feature - optional) I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list
